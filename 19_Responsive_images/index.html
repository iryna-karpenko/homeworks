                <p>
                    FashHanger is a bespoke sustainable high-fashion accessory company based out of Berlin, currently
                    operated by Siesly and her sister Ashely. They needed help for a big rebrand and wanted to
                    relaunch their website.

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Their goals were simple, create a unique e-commerce store that bring a wonderful shopping
                    experience at every stage of the buyer’s journey.

                        Originally, the personality section of this persona was based off the Myers Briggs personality
                        test.
                        According to the Myers Briggs, there are 16 potential user personality types. Our template
                        integrates questions from this online personality test example into a series of sliding bar
                        graphics. If you’re confused as to what the sliders mean, check out the Myers Briggs basics
                        article.

                        In the beginning, It’s just about brainstorming.

                        I list out a jumble of words and draw tiny sketches related to what I’m working on (and find the
                        parallels later). Personally, I prefer paper with a grid so I can convey things responsively.
                        Most of the time perfection isn’t an issue and the sketches are just for me.

                        I played with adding a wireframe of the website flow that would lead you in to each screen. For
                        each of those screens I added a floating footer that allows users to see where they are in that
                        particular flow and jump around as needed.” We’re digging this InVision-made wireframe. </p>
